# UREP
Our team aimed to create a parking detection program that would be able to observe cars in a street parking environment and identify open spots with high accuracy. The program takes in a video feed and applies the model to identify vehicles within a frame and then notifies users when a parking spot in the frame opens up. 
Our program aims to streamline finding parking by automating the process, relying on a model with the capacity to alert users when a parking spot is open, or opening up. 
Using : Keras 2.3.1, OpenCV-Python 4.2.0.34, Tensorflow 1.15.2, ImageAI 2.1.5, PyCharm, Python 3.7, YoloV3
Using openCV, video input data (live or prerecorded) is broken down frame by frame and fed into ImageAIâ€™s CustomObjectDetection method.
By calculating the center of each set of box points and creating a dictionary of centroids per frame we are able individualize objects.
